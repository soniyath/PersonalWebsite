        I worked at Gino's pizza for 2 years and still working as well as improving my customer representation, management and Supervisng skills. Customers really like the Dough tricks I use during the dough stretching process. Meanwhile, I learnt the spiral
        strectch which is the fastest and one of the rarest kind of stretch. Had positions from pizza chef, head chef, crew trainer and finally Supervisor in just 2 years using my focusing abilities at the age of 20
