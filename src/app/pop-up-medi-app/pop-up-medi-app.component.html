    <p>
        A Web Application with user friendly-UI fulfilling the purpose of registering, managing and ultimately storing the patient data into the hospital database for future usage by providing ease of access to the Hospital Team.
    </p>
    <h3>Project overview</h3>
    <p>
        The purpose of this application is to provide an intuitive and organized solution for medical staff to access important patient information. Through the use of the application’s dashboard, medical staff will be able to access relevant data incredibly
        quickly. Functionality will be changed according to the kind of staff that has logged in. Nurses will be able to create new patients and update patient information such as address or allergies, while Doctors are able to access sensitive health
        data like blood pressure and other vitals. These differences in functionality will be reflected in the application’s user interface. Patient data will be read only from the dashboard as privacy and safety is of top priority. This application will
        be developed using the latest version of Visual Studio (16.1.6) as well as MySQL Server (8.0.16). The project will be written using the C# programming language and will implement various technologies such as Windows Forms, the .NET framework,
        web services, and a MySQL database for storing patient and staff information.
