    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
        An average human being gets about 60,000 - 80,000 thoughts in a day. That's about 2500 - 3,300 thoughts an hour.
        <br> However, most of them are useless. Just imagine if you could cut everything off and sit still with absolute zero thoughts in the mind full of warmth and bliss! No thoughts for 30mins - that's REAL BREAK.. REAL RELAXATION; that blissful relaxation
        of cutting off everything is MEDITATION. Instead of consuming more information on netflix over same over whelming day and having same broken chain of thoughts for next 3 days overriding your work focus.
        <br> The reason people can focus well who meditate often times is because to focus on one thing requires yourself to filter out thoughts into lesser numebr until you get a single most important thing to focus on! In meditation you focus on nothing
        and in a productive process you focus on only one thing.. CLOSE ENOUGH?
        <br> However, none of those can be really achieved having as many as 2500 things going on in your mind in as less time as 60mins.
