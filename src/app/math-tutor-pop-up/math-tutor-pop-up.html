    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        One of the main reasons I chose programming and earning a software engineering degree was the problem solving and mathematics. Often times I helped my professor Mrs. Samar Haddad for management, problem solving and providing different ways to make my
        classmates understand the complicated topics of Computer Math Fundamentals. Observing my passion and intrest, she provided me with position of Peer Assisted Learning Leader for Computer Math Fundamentals. My responsibilities involved taking over
        3 - 1 hour lectures a week where I helped the juniors of 3 sections (91 students) to learn and understand the historically complicated concepts of mathematics.
